# 👋 Hi, I’m Oussama Farhani  

- 👀 I’m interested in:
  - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, especially in applying CNN models for image classification.  
  - IoT and smart systems, like my current project on a **Smart Agriculture System** to increase crop yield using IoT, drones, and data analytics.  
  - Software development and desktop applications, as seen in my internship project creating a PyQt5-based application for product database exploration and price calculation.  

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - Advanced topics in AI and image processing, including disease detection in plants using captured images.  
  - Networking, microprocessors, thermodynamics, heat transfer, and more as part of my ongoing studies.  
  - Data science through **Datacamp** to strengthen my analytical skills.  

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - Innovative AI projects, particularly those that intersect with IoT and agriculture.  
  - Software tools that enhance productivity or solve real-world problems.
